ClassSim is the name of one of my advanced programming projects and it's more about getting familiar with working with class and using multi-file in cpp.
the whole idea was that we needed a program to simulate the system of university classes, we had three roles:1_professor,2_student, and 3_admin, Admin could perform CRUD operations on other
users and soft delete any user,The professor could create a new lesson and assign students to it or remove any student they want and create homework and grade their students by their homework. Student users
could see all of their classes and submit answers for every class homework, and see the grade of that homework.
we also needed a suitable Data-saving method for user information and class information such that everything is clear and understandable.
